      <h3>Stochastic Double Dummy Solver</h3>
      <p> This improves on a standard double dummy solver to evaluate declarer and defensive plays. The goal is to be able to determine what the optimal play for a situation was a priori, including constraints from the bidding but not unknown information about other players' hands. To evaluate plays, it generates N (N <= 200) random boards with the given deals for the current player and dummy which satisfy the constraints provided, runs a double-dummy solver on each, and averages the results. Although it's still a crude approximation, we can use this to estimate the expected number of IMPs gained or lost by playing a specific card against a partnership with the same deal, contract, and earlier plays who made a different choice, assuming both sides play optimally afterwards. </p>
     <p> (This doesn't work yet for modelling the initial lead, since my implementation currently only generates deals filling in two unknown hands. I might add this later if I have time.)</p>
     <p> The input specification, technical details, and source code are here: <a href="https://github.com/VietaFan/bridge-sdds">https://github.com/VietaFan/bridge-sdds</a>. The underlying double dummy simulations are run on a Raspberry Pi using Bo Haglund and Soren Hein's optimized C++ double dummy <a href="https://github.com/dds-bridge/dds">solver</a>. </p>
